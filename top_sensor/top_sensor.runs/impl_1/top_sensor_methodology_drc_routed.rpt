The clock pin ubtn/q_reg_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ubtn/q_reg_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ubtn/q_reg_reg[5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Critical Warning

The clock pin ubtn/q_reg_reg[6]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#10 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ubtn/q_reg_reg[7]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -11.161 ns between usensor/data_reg_reg[1]_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and uuart/uclock_Tx/data_reg_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -11.174 ns between usensor/data_reg_reg[1]_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and uuart/uclock_Tx/data_reg_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -11.184 ns between usensor/data_reg_reg[1]_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and uuart/uclock_Tx/data_reg_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -11.200 ns between usensor/data_reg_reg[1]_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and uuart/uclock_Tx/data_reg_reg[3]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
